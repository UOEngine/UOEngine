## Introduction

UOEngine will be a fully self contained editor with tools and client for creating and editing Ultima Online freeshards. If you are familiar with game engines such as Unreal and Unity, they have their own editor and tools to allow you to build and package a final game. The idea behind UOEngine is similar.  

## Roadmap and Features

- Highly modular client using the runtime set up. Matches the original Ultima Online client. Every aspect easily configurable via plugins to extend or modify for your needs. 

- Editor set up with embedded client for debugging with built in server for testing using ServUO or connect to your own remote one. Again customisability is king and ability to extend and modify. 

- Integrate further tools into the editor such as map creation for a complete server and client customisation experience.
